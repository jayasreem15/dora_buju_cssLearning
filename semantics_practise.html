            Dorabji, apart from managing the affairs of the Tata Group, was himself a keen athlete and excellent horseman. Even as he watched these peasant athletes, he was filled with a desire to see an Indian team participate in the Olympics. How could India, a proud nation, not field its own team at the largest and most prestigious sporting event in the world.
